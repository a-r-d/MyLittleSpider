    This application was built using Adobe Flex, an open source framework
    for building rich Internet applications that get delivered via the
    Flash Player or to desktops via Adobe AIR.

Include CSS to eliminate any default margins/padding and set the height of the html element and 
             the body element to 100%, because Firefox, or any Gecko based browser, interprets percentage as 
             the percentage of the height of its parent container, which has to be set explicitly.  Fix for
             Firefox 3.6 focus border issues.  Initially, don't display flashContent div so it won't show 
             if JavaScript disabled.
html, body  { height:100%; }
            body { margin:0; padding:0; overflow:auto; text-align:center; 
                   background-color: #333333; }   
            object:focus { outline:none; }
            #flashContent { display:none; }

                "GravityEscape.swf", "flashContent", 
                "800", "600", 
                swfVersionStr, xiSwfUrlStr, 
                flashvars, params, attributes);
            // JavaScript enabled so display the flashContent div in case it is not replaced with a swf object.
            swfobject.createCSS("#flashContent", "display:block;text-align:left;");
SWFObject's dynamic embed method replaces this alternative HTML content with Flash content when enough 
             JavaScript and Flash plug-in support is available. The div is initially hidden so that it doesn't show
             when JavaScript is disabled.

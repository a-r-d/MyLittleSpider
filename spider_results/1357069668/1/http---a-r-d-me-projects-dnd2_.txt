About:
Click below on the folders to navigate to a particular gallery. I like to organize my photos by camera. 
				The D5000 is the newest camera that I own. The D50 is the oldest DLSR. This uses PHP on the backend to iterate over the gallery directory,
				so anything you drop in there will be viewable and easy to navigate to from the web. There is no limit to recursive depth, but the next level will not show
				up until you navigate to one above it.

Apache Axis 1.4 Tutorial – Making a Java Webservice with Tomcat 6. Part 1.

Apache AXIS is a SOAP Web Service that does really cool things like automatically expose existing java classes as web services with no modification. I will take you through the entire install and testing of a simple web service like this. We will even give it a math quiz.
First thing we need to is to set up Tomcat to help with this simple example. On windows, you need to set two environmental variables:
CATALINA_HOME
(which is the path to your tomcat directory- eg c:\servers\tomcat)
<!--
	google_ad_client = "pub-9622909715647886";
	google_alternate_color = "FFFFFF";
	google_ad_width = 336;
	google_ad_height = 280;
	google_ad_format = "336x280_as";
	google_ad_type = "text";
	google_ad_channel ="";
	google_color_border = "";
	google_color_link = "";
	google_color_bg = "";
	google_color_text = "";
	google_color_url = "";
	google_ui_features = "rc:0";

	//-->
and
JRE_HOME
(which is the path your JRE install- eg c:\Program Files\java\jre6)
and
JAVA_HOME
(Axis needs this, not Tomcat eg: C:\jdk1.6.0_27 -yes AXIS actually needs the full JDK)
Check the screenshot below for hints here.

Now you need to get a copy of AXIS. Get it from here, unzip it, and drop the “axis” directory from you download into the tomcat install under “webapps”. Second thing is you need the libraries. Go to axis/lib and copy all these .jar files over into the tomcat/lib directory.
Before you lauch tomcat you should also check some things:
1. What port are you running on?
If there is a conflict go to tomcat/conf/server.xml and change the “port” attribute from the first “connector” tag to something else. I usually run on something other than 8080 (default).
2. Do you have any users set up in tomcat-users.xml?
If not throw one in there. I usually just run everything with “test” in all fields when developing.
Now you can run startup.bat out of the tomcat/bin directory.
Go to http://localhost:8084  (or http://localhost:8080  if you didn’t change it!).
If it is working, try to see if axis deployed OK. We dropped axis into the webapps directory so go ahead and navigate to http://localhost:8084/axis/  where you should see something like this:
[screenshot]
Now you will likely get some error that looks like this if you try to click “Call” on the main AXIS page:
No compiler found in your classpath!  (you may need to add 'tools.jar')
This may be because you don’t have the full JDK installed. Yes AXIS actually needs to compile stuff. The other possibility is that it is looking the JRE path for tools.jar… it will not find it! In this case you will have to copy tools.jar from the jdk/lib/tools.jar into tomcat/lib/ to get this working. It is 12 megabytes, you can’t miss it. This is what I had to do.
Try it again and you should get something like this:
[screenshot]
<!--
	google_ad_client = "pub-9622909715647886";
	google_alternate_color = "FFFFFF";
	google_ad_width = 468;
	google_ad_height = 60;
	google_ad_format = "468x60_as";
	google_ad_type = "text";
	google_ad_channel ="";
	google_color_border = "";
	google_color_link = "";
	google_color_bg = "";
	google_color_text = "";
	google_color_url = "";
	google_ui_features = "rc:0";

	//-->
Okay so now lets try and actually do something. You are very likely here because your boss told you that you need to use AXIS and now you are trying to figure out what it is even for. So let’s do some examples. The easiest will be a very simple calculator class so here is what you will do:
Write the following and save it as “Calc.jws”:
public class Calc {
  public int add(int i1, int i2) {
    return i1 + i2; 
  }

  public int subtract(int i1, int i2) {
    return i1 - i2;
  }
}
Now copy this file into tomcat/webapps/axis/ yes, right into the root of the axis directory under your Tomcat Webapps. Now visit:
http://localhost:8084/axis/Calc.jws
And visit the link “click to see WSDL”.
An exceprt we will use:
 
<wsdl:operation name="add" parameterOrder="i1 i2">
    <wsdl:input message="impl:addRequest" name="addRequest"/>
    <wsdl:output message="impl:addResponse" name="addResponse"/>
</wsdl:operation>
Alright so there is that worked well right? Just add “?wsdl” to the end of the path to the webservice and you get the whole spec printed back. Now how do we communicate with this thing? It looks like we should be able to send it a command with an argument and it should spit stuff out right?
Can you just call it like this? -
http://localhost:8084/axis/Calc.jws?method=add&i1=3&i2=4
Yes. You should get something like:
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <soapenv:Body>
        <addResponse soapenv:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">
            <addReturn xsi:type="xsd:int">7</addReturn>
        </addResponse>
    </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
Right, 3 + 4 = 7. The arguments were i1 and i2 for integer one and integer two. You should notice we got back a typed response also. Everything in AXIS is typed.

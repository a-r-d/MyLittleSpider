MyLittleSpider
==============

What Is It?

  -A simple web spider that pulls pages then follows all of the links on them, and so on.
  -It saves the page contents to a text file.
  -You can set recursive depth.


Future work:

  -Make it write to a DB.
  -Make it parameterized!
  -Package it with non std lib dependencies (only BeautifulSoup currently)
